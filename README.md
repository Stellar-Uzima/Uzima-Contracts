## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, security scanning, and deployment.

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Continuous Integration (CI)

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push and pull request:

- **Code Formatting**: Checks code formatting with `cargo fmt`
- **Linting**: Runs Clippy with strict warnings
- **Unit Tests**: Executes all unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Runs integration tests with Soroban CLI
- **Build**: Builds optimized WASM contracts
- **Shell Script Linting**: Validates shell scripts with ShellCheck

```bash
# View CI status
# Check the "Actions" tab on GitHub or:
gh workflow view ci.yml
```

#### Security Scanning

The security workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) performs automated security checks:

- **Dependency Audit**: Scans for known vulnerabilities with `cargo-audit`
- **Security-focused Clippy**: Checks for security anti-patterns
- **Secret Scanning**: Detects hardcoded secrets with Gitleaks
- **Dependency Review**: Reviews dependency changes in PRs

Runs on:
- Every push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (scheduled)

#### Automated Testnet Deployment

The deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-testnet.yml`) automatically deploys to testnet:

**Triggers:**
- Pushes to `develop` branch
- Version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Process:**
1. Runs pre-deployment tests (unless skipped)
2. Builds optimized contracts
3. Deploys to testnet
4. Verifies deployments
5. Creates deployment summary

**Configuration:**

Set up the following GitHub secrets:
- `TESTNET_DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for testnet deployment account

```bash
# Manual deployment via GitHub Actions
gh workflow run deploy-testnet.yml \
  --field contract=medical_records \
  --field skip_tests=false
```

### Deployment Scripts

#### Enhanced Deployment with Rollback

Deploy contracts with automatic backup and rollback support:

```bash
# Deploy with rollback enabled (default)
./scripts/deploy_with_rollback.sh medical_records testnet

# Deploy without rollback
./scripts/deploy_with_rollback.sh medical_records testnet default --no-rollback
```

**Features:**
- Automatic backup of current deployment
- Rollback on deployment failure
- Contract verification after deployment
- Deployment metadata tracking

#### Environment-based Deployment

Deploy all contracts to a specific environment:

```bash
# Deploy all contracts to testnet
./scripts/deploy_environment.sh testnet

# Deploy specific contracts
./scripts/deploy_environment.sh testnet --contracts medical_records,identity_registry

# Skip tests (not recommended)
./scripts/deploy_environment.sh testnet --skip-tests
```

**Environments:**
- `local`: Local development network
- `testnet`: Stellar testnet
- `futurenet`: Stellar futurenet (staging)
- `mainnet`: Production mainnet (requires confirmation)

#### Deployment Monitoring

Monitor deployed contracts and receive alerts:

```bash
# Monitor all deployments on testnet
./scripts/monitor_deployments.sh testnet

# Monitor with alerts on failure
./scripts/monitor_deployments.sh testnet --alert-on-failure
```

**Features:**
- Health checks for all deployed contracts
- Contract verification
- Alert generation for unhealthy contracts
- Deployment status reporting

#### Rollback Deployment

Rollback a contract to a previous version:

```bash
# Interactive rollback (selects latest backup)
./scripts/rollback_deployment.sh medical_records testnet

# Rollback to specific backup
./scripts/rollback_deployment.sh medical_records testnet \
  deployments/testnet_medical_records_backup_20240101_120000.json
```

**Process:**
1. Lists available backups
2. Verifies backup contract exists
3. Restores deployment configuration
4. Logs rollback action

#### Deployment Status

View deployment status across all networks:

```bash
# Show all deployments
./scripts/deployment_status.sh

# Show deployments for specific network
./scripts/deployment_status.sh testnet
```

**Information displayed:**
- Contract names and IDs
- Deployment timestamps
- Rollback status
- Backup availability
- Rollback history

### Deployment Workflow

#### Standard Deployment Process

1. **Development**: Make changes and test locally
   ```bash
   make test
   make build-opt
   ```

2. **CI Validation**: Push to branch triggers CI
   - Tests run automatically
   - Security scans execute
   - Build artifacts created

3. **Testnet Deployment**: Merge to `develop` triggers testnet deployment
   - Contracts deployed automatically
   - Verification runs
   - Status reported

4. **Production Deployment**: Manual deployment to mainnet
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy_environment.sh mainnet
   ```

#### Rollback Process

If a deployment fails or issues are detected:

1. **Identify Issue**: Check deployment logs and monitoring
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor_deployments.sh testnet
   ```

2. **Review Backups**: List available backups
   ```bash
   ./scripts/rollback_deployment.sh medical_records testnet
   ```

3. **Execute Rollback**: Restore previous version
   ```bash
   ./scripts/rollback_deployment.sh medical_records testnet <backup_file>
   ```

4. **Verify**: Confirm rollback success
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor_deployments.sh testnet
   ```

### Deployment Artifacts

Deployment information is stored in the `deployments/` directory:

```
deployments/
├── testnet_medical_records.json          # Current deployment
├── testnet_medical_records_backup_*.json # Backup files
├── rollback_log.json                     # Rollback history
└── alerts.log                            # Alert log
```

**Deployment File Format:**
```json
{
  "contract_name": "medical_records",
  "contract_id": "C...",
  "network": "testnet",
  "deployer": "deployer-testnet",
  "deployed_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "wasm_hash": "...",
  "commit_sha": "..."
}
```

### CI/CD Best Practices

1. **Always run tests locally** before pushing
2. **Review CI results** before merging PRs
3. **Monitor deployments** after each release
4. **Keep backups** for critical deployments
5. **Use rollback** when issues are detected
6. **Document** any manual deployment steps

### Troubleshooting

#### CI Failures

- **Formatting errors**: Run `cargo fmt --all`
- **Clippy warnings**: Fix warnings or add `#[allow(...)]` with justification
- **Test failures**: Review test output and fix issues
- **Build failures**: Check Rust version and dependencies

#### Deployment Failures

- **Network issues**: Verify network connectivity and RPC endpoints
- **Insufficient funds**: Fund deployment account
- **Contract errors**: Check contract logs and verify WASM file
- **Identity issues**: Ensure identity is properly configured

#### Rollback Issues

- **No backups**: Previous deployments weren't backed up
- **Invalid backup**: Backup file may be corrupted
- **Contract not found**: Backup contract may have been removed
